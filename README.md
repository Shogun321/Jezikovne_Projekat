## Deep Neural Network Model


### Architecture of the Neural Network
From the previous Section, we see that the model gets 132 features. Recalling that there are 1400000 training examples and 350000 testing examples, we input the training examples into the Deep NN. We used Keras with Tensorflow to achieve this task. <br />
